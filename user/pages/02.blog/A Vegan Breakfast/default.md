<p>If you grew up in the south you know that butter and cheese are a staple in just about every dish. Changing my diet, <i>I thought</i>, meant eliminating some of my all time favorite foods.Fortunately though, over time, I've been able to incorporate delicious, cruelty-free versions of all the foods from my past. This post does include some "pricier" items but I've found that sometimes you have to splurge and give into your cravings - after all, the more you try to limit yourself the harder the transition can become and eating a vegan diet should never feel restrictive or suppressive. So give in every once in a while!</p>

<p>So today I am here to say that (with some minor tweaks) you CAN have a cruelty free version of whatever it is you've previously enjoyed!</p>

<p>Every Christmas morning for as long as I can remember we have gone to my Granny's house for breakfast. She'd wake up at four or five a.m. to start an array of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, biscuits, hashbrowns and my personal favorite: GRITS. When I first became a vegetarian Christmas morning was easy because I could still scarf down all the ooey gooey, cheesy, buttery grits I wanted, but being vegan made it A LOT harder. My options had dwindled down to the hashbrowns and maybe a biscuit if I could sneak a look at the ingredients on the can...</p>

<p>Personally I try to keep some vegan butter in my fridge at all times. My favorite is the <a href="https://earthbalancenatural.com/product/olive-oil-buttery-spread/">Earth Balance Olive Oil Buttery Spread</a>. For $3-$6 you, depending on location and purchasing store, you can have a tub of vegan butter available for a multitude of uses. Use it to bake, sautee veggies or - in this case - add creaminess to your grits.</p>

<p>As with most things in life, nothing is perfect. I have to admit I am not a big fan of vegan cheese. There always seem to be something lacking. My pre-vegan self would grab pinches of shredded cheese straight from the bag and drop it right in my mouth - deemed the "cheese shot." With vegan cheese, though, cheese shots are a thing of the past. While I do feel the vegan cheese alternatives are lackluster eaten straight from the bag, they do sometimes add a stringy, cheesy
goodness to dishes that you can't get from anything else.  Such is the case with these grits!! <a href="https://daiyafoods.com">Daiya's</a> shreds are my go-to and in this instance I used the mozzarella style shreds but cheddar would work great as well!</p>

<p>Moving onto the staple of this meal I have to introduce the priciest item of the bunch. What it takes from your wallet is more than made up for with what it does for your taste buds. Prior to this discovery I had pretty much given up all hope on a suitable bacon substitute. Once, on a trip to Miami, I tried some veggie bacon at a Kosher Dunkin Donuts that was pretty decent but there was no way I would be able to make a 400+ mile trip every time I had a bacon craving. So bacon was a thing of my past - or so I thought! When I found <a href="https://lightlife.com/products/organic-fakin-bacon-tempeh-strips">this tempeh bacon</a> everything changed. I'm telling you I almost cried when I tasted this stuff because of the endless possibilities that started running through my head. It tastes <b>JUST</b> like bacon y'all. It smells like bacon when you cook it, it crunches like bacon when you burn it (trust me on this one), and it is the perfet rebuttal to when ignorant carnivores make "mmmm but what about bacon," comments. I get all the yumminess of bacon without the slaughter of an innocent animal OR the high fat content. <b>MY</b> bacon is made with beans!</p>
<p>I will link to the recipe for this once it is up but for now just take into consideration that you dont have to give up anything when eating vegan - just the animal cruelty!</p>
