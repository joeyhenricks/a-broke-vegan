Have you ever heard the excuse, "being plant based is too expensive"? I certainly have and that couldn't be farther from the truth. From friends, to family and coworkers, I've heard plenty of reasons <b>NOT</b> to adopt a planet based diet and almost no reasons that are actually based in facts. I hope to show that embracing a vegan diet can not only be delicious but certainly won't break the bank. In fact, you may find yourself saving money by avoiding pricey meats, cheese and processed food items. Every little step taken to avoid animal products helps not only your health, but the health and wellness of animals and our planet!
