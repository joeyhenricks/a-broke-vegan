A few months ago a coworker came in raving about this salsa-like dip thing she was snacking on and how I could try it since it was vegan (which never happens). One bite and I asked her for the recipe. The recipe I am about to share is an adaptation of the one she gave me with some tweaks to make it a little more healthy, protein filled and <b>SPICY!</b> Hope you enjoy!
