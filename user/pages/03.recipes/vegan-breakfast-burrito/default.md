These breakfast burritos are inspired by a local health food stores non vegan version that I frequently enjoyed. This version is vegan, cheap and easy to make!! I ususally prepare all 6 at one time and keep them in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week as a quick grab when I'm walking out the door. 

<p>
<p><u>What You'll Need:</u></p>

<p>* 6 Medium Tortillas, (personally I use Tomato-Basil wraps, but you could use whole-wheat, spinach, white or whatever your heart desires)
	<p>* 1 Bell Pepper (color of your choosing) <i>-chopped</i>
    <p>* 1 Medium Yellow Onion <i>-chopped</i>
    <p>* 3 cups of Frozen Shredded Hashbrown Potatoes 
  	<p>* 1 Package of <a href="http://lightlife.com/products/organic-fakin-bacon-tempeh-strips">Fakin' Bacon</a> 
	<p>* 6 Tablespoons of <a href="https://followyourheart.com/vegenaise-7/">Veganaise</a> 
    <p>* 8 Tablespoons of Sriracha		 
	<p>* Salt <i>to taste</i>
    <p>* Pepper <i>to taste</i>
    <p>* Garlic Powder <i>to taste</i>
    <p>* Olive Oil 
        
<p><u>What To Do:</u>
    <p>1. In one pan cook the bellpepper and onion on medium-high heat. Personally I like to basically steam the veggies by adding water to the bottom of the pan and cooking them until the are almost all the way soft (about 7-8 minutes) adding small amounts of water along the way when the veggies start to stick. In another pan, heat enough oil to barely cover the bottom of your pan and sautee your bacon strips (you can follow the package directions for this) until they are brown, flipping them along the way to cook the other side.
    <p>2. Once the bell pepper and onion are almost completely soft, add the shredded hashbrown potatoes. Cook until all three are soft. 
    <p>3. Cut the bacon strips in half so that you are left with 18 pieces (3 for each burrito).
    <p>4.
